# Start Coding Today 

## 2021 VMware TechSummit Session
Co-presented by Patrick Kremer and Nico Vibert.
This session will be presented at the internal VMware conference TechSummit.

## Objectives

In 25 minutes, attendees will be able to learn and practice coding.

## Requirements

A browser with Internet access.

That's it. No coding experience required. No need to get access to a vCenter as a simulated vCenter will be provided.

## What the attendee will do during the session:

* Learn the basic concepts behind REST APIs
* Run a PowerCLI script against a vCenter
* Run API calls with Postman against a vCenter
* Execute an API call with Python against a vCenter
* Deploy VMware resources with Terraform

## Session Structure

### Part 1 - Introduction

Welcome to the session. This session is for anyone who's never had the confidence or the motivation to learn to code. 
It's hard to get started with coding without a use case, a mentor, an environment you can learn and a safe place where there's no stupid questions.

This is a short session and this session is more of an introduction to coding for folks who have a background as infrastructure and virtualization administrators and would like to understand the 'art of the possible'. 

### Part 2 - APIs

// brief introduction to REST APIs
// CRUD

If you are on the live VMware training, access your virtual desktop
### Part 3a - Desktop Access

Access your VDI session at this [URL](https://desktop.vmc.ninja)

Usernames and passwords will be provided in the Zoom session.

### Part 3b - Preparation

### Part 4 - PowerCLI

PowerCLI is one of the most common tools to automate tasks against a VMware environment. PowerCLI abstracts the API calls by providing a command-line interface tool that is self-explanatory.

Open the PowerShell windows and run the following command:

    New-VM blablablablab
    New-Tag blablablabla

Great! You've just used some scripts to create vSphere resources over APIs. Yes, PowerCLI just executes some API calls under the hood but a lot of the complexity was hidden from you.

You can combine multiple PowerCLI commands into a single PowerShell script and the script will run everything for you. 

Navigate to the Folder /blablablabla and open the file blablablabla.ps1

As you can see, the script will do the following:

    - create this
    - create that
    - create that
    - run some checks

While that's fine. 

### Part 5 - 

PowerCLI is one of the most common tools to automate tasks against a VMware environment. PowerCLI abstracts the API calls by providing a command-line interface tool that is easy to learn and to use.
